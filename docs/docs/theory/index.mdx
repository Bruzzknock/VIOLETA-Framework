# Introduction to the VIOLETA Framework

**VIOLETA** (Versatile Interactive Ontology-based Learning Environment for Teaching & Assessment) is a structured approach to designing educational games where **playing more means learning more.**

This guide will help you quickly understand:

- Why VIOLETA exists  
- The psychology behind it  
- Its main ideas and components  
- How it‚Äôs different from other frameworks  

For a **deep dive**, check the full thesis (linked [here](#)).

## Why Was VIOLETA Created?

Many of us spend hours playing games, learning to master them. Imagine if the same energy could be directed to real-life skills‚Äîlike negotiation, strategic thinking, or time management.

VIOLETA was born out of this question:

> **Can we design games that feel just as engaging but teach skills we can actually use?**

Kristijan √êokic developed VIOLETA to fill a gap: while many educational games exist, they often **don‚Äôt clearly connect** what you do in the game to what you learn in life. Existing models either:
- stay too vague (just saying ‚Äúadd learning material‚Äù), or
- become too rigid (forcing designers into a fixed set of rules).

VIOLETA offers a **structured yet flexible** way to design games that:

- Are fun and motivating  
- Teach bundled, practical skills  
- Adjust difficulty as you improve

## The Theory Behind VIOLETA

To understand how VIOLETA works, let‚Äôs look at three core ideas:

---

### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

According to SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2000), people are most motivated when three needs are met:

1. **Competence** ‚Äì feeling effective and improving
2. **Autonomy** ‚Äì having choices and control
3. **Relatedness** ‚Äì feeling connected to others

Games are naturally good at fulfilling these. For example:
- A strategy game gives clear feedback on competence.
- An open-world game supports autonomy.
- Multiplayer modes satisfy relatedness.

This is why games are so engaging. VIOLETA builds on this: if learning is embedded into gameplay, players stay motivated.

---

### Cognitive Load Theory

Learning involves **working memory** (short-term) and **long-term memory**.  
- Working memory can only handle a few things at once (Sweller et al., 1998).
- If you overload it, learning breaks down.

Good games **control cognitive load**:
- They introduce new concepts gradually.
- They help players chunk information into schemas (mental models).

VIOLETA makes this explicit: as players progress, the game slowly increases complexity, matching their growing mastery.

---

### Play as Evolutionary Practice

From *The Play of Animals* (Groos, 1898), we know:
> Animals practice skills through play to prepare for real challenges.

Humans are the same. We‚Äôre wired to enjoy play because it helps us learn.  
VIOLETA leverages this by making complex topics feel like ‚Äúsafe practice.‚Äù

---

## The Core Principles of VIOLETA

VIOLETA is built on **five principles**:

1. **Skill-Mapped Gameplay**  
   Every action should directly support real-world skills.  
   You don‚Äôt just *read* about a skill‚Äîyou *practice* it.

2. **Adaptable Difficulty**  
   The game scales up as you get better.  
   You stay challenged but never overwhelmed.

3. **Intrinsic Motivation**  
   Games must be enjoyable on their own‚Äînot because you ‚Äúhave to‚Äù play.  
   This keeps players coming back.

4. **Emotionally Aligned Learning**  
   Emotional experiences (e.g., feeling progress, pressure, or mastery) make learning stick.  
   Mechanics should reinforce these emotions.

5. **Respect for Creativity**  
   VIOLETA offers structure but doesn‚Äôt dictate aesthetics or stories.  
   Designers have freedom to shape the experience.

## The Three Pillars of VIOLETA

Think of VIOLETA as a **triangle** with three pillars:

---

### 1. Atomic Unit

The **atomic unit** is the *bundle of skills or knowledge* you want players to master.

Examples:
- Time management
- Empathy
- Systems thinking

Unlike traditional ‚Äúlearning objectives,‚Äù an atomic unit groups related skills into one cohesive target.

---

### 2. Theme

The **theme** defines the setting, story, and emotional flavor.

Examples:
- A young entrepreneur juggling life and work
- A spaceship crew managing limited resources

The theme does more than look pretty:
- It makes skills feel real and engaging.
- It frames the learning in an intuitive way.

---

### 3. Mechanics

**Mechanics** are how players interact:
- What they do
- What decisions they make
- How they get feedback

Mechanics are **the bridge** between skills and play. Mastering the game means mastering the target skills.

---

## Integrating the Pillars

What makes VIOLETA unique is **how these pillars connect**:

- **Atomic Unit + Mechanics = Skill-Mapped Gameplay**  
  Mechanics *require* practicing the skills.

- **Theme + Mechanics = Emotional & Cognitive Support**  
  The story makes the mechanics feel relevant and engaging.

- **Atomic Unit + Theme = Conceptual Framing**  
  The setting helps players understand *why* the skills matter.

- **Triadic Integration**  
  When all three pillars align, the experience is coherent and powerful.

## Supporting Designers Without Killing Creativity

Many frameworks either:
- Over-constrain the designer, or
- Leave them guessing.

VIOLETA balances this by:
- Giving **clear steps** and tools (like skill-emotion mapping tables).
- Encouraging intuitive creativity (System 1) and structured reasoning (System 2).

You can think of it like music production:
- The framework is your set of instruments.
- How you play them is up to you.

## What Comes Next?

This introduction covers:
- Why VIOLETA exists  
- The psychology behind it  
- Its core components and philosophy  

If you want to **see how to apply it in practice**, Chapter 3 of the thesis shows a **step-by-step walkthrough**, including:
- Defining your atomic unit
- Selecting the theme
- Designing mechanics
- Prototyping and refining
