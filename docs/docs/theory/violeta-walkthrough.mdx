# üõ†Ô∏è VIOLETA Framework ‚Äì Step-by-Step Guide

In the previous section, we explained what VIOLETA is and why it exists.  
Now let‚Äôs see **how you actually use it to design an educational game**.

This part walks you through each step of the process, from defining learning goals to creating a playable prototype and preparing adaptive difficulty.

---

## üß≠ Overview of the Steps

VIOLETA is structured in **13 steps**, but don‚Äôt worry‚Äîmany of them are short.  

Here‚Äôs a roadmap:

1. **Define the Atomic Unit**  
2. **Identify the Skills Inside the Atomic Unit**  
3. **Select a Theme**  
4. **Define the Intended Emotional Experience**  
5. **Layer Feelings (LF) Process**  
6. **Form a Game (FAG)**  
7. **Build a Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP)**  
8. **Create the Scaling Influence Table (SIT)**  
9. **Calibrate Challenge with Adaptive Difficulty**  
10. **Temporal Structuring & Schema Graph**  
11. **Schema Adjacency Matrix**  
12. **Estimate Cognitive Load**  
13. **Build the Cognitive Load Matrix**

Below you‚Äôll find a short explanation for each.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Atomic Unit

**What is the bundled set of skills or knowledge you want the game to teach?**

Unlike a single objective, the **Atomic Unit** can be a cluster of related skills.

‚úÖ *Example:*  
> *Time management skills as a whole.*

‚úÖ *Other examples:*  
> *Negotiation, strategic planning, empathy.*

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Skills Inside the Atomic Unit

Break down your Atomic Unit into **sub-skills**.

‚úÖ *Example for Time Management:*

- Using a calendar
- Prioritizing tasks
- Saying no
- Avoiding procrastination

This helps you later map each skill to mechanics.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Select a Theme

Pick a **narrative context** that naturally connects to your Atomic Unit.

‚úÖ *Ask yourself:*  
> ‚ÄúIn what world does someone use these skills every day?‚Äù

‚úÖ *Example:*  
> A 20-year-old juggling a startup, studies, fitness, and friends.

Your theme should feel engaging and relevant.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Define the Intended Emotional Experience

Describe **what the player should feel** as they play.

‚úÖ *Example:*  
- Overwhelm ‚û°Ô∏è Gradual control ‚û°Ô∏è Satisfaction

‚úÖ *Tip:*  
Write a **short paragraph** explaining this arc. This becomes your emotional compass.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Layer Feelings (LF) Process

Organize your target emotions:

- Are some emotions **nested inside others**?
- Do they happen **in sequence**?

‚úÖ *Example hierarchy:*

- Progress
  - Gradual Control
- Constant Pressure

This helps you design mechanics that reinforce these feelings.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Form a Game (FAG)

Time to **match emotions to mechanics**.

For each emotion:

1. Pick or invent a mechanic that naturally creates that feeling.
2. Make sure the mechanic connects to the skills you identified.

‚úÖ *Example:*

- *Progress* ‚û°Ô∏è Deck building system (unlocking better cards)
- *Gradual control* ‚û°Ô∏è Expanding the number of options over time
- *Constant pressure* ‚û°Ô∏è Tight deadlines or limited resources

‚úÖ *Tip:*  
Don‚Äôt worry if these are still abstract‚Äîconcrete systems come next.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Build a Minimum Viable Prototype (MVP)

Translate abstract mechanics into **real game components and rules**.

‚úÖ *Ask:*
- What do players actually do?
- What are the cards, tokens, or screens?
- How do they get feedback?

‚úÖ *Example:*
- Players draw 2 cards per day (limited options).
- As they upgrade, they draw more cards and gain flexibility.
- Cards represent tasks taking time and energy.

‚úÖ *Goal:*  
End up with a *list of all game systems*, called the **List of Schemas**.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Create the Scaling Influence Table (SIT)

This table links:

- Each **skill**
- Each **emotion**
- The mechanics that affect them

‚úÖ *Purpose:*
Clarify which mechanics strengthen which skills and feelings.

‚úÖ *Example:*

| Skill               | Progress | Constant Pressure |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------|
| Time Planning       | ‚úÖ       |                   |
| Task Management     | ‚úÖ       |                   |
| Goal Setting        | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ               |

‚úÖ *Tip:*  
Mark only **direct connections**.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Calibrate Challenge with Adaptive Difficulty

Introduce **STACK** (Structured Tiered Adaptive Core Knowledge):

- Break down complexity into **tiers**.
- Each tier adds new schemas only after players master the basics.
- Prevents overload.

‚úÖ *Example:*
- **Tier 1:** Just drawing and playing cards
- **Tier 2:** Energy management and more options
- **Tier 3:** Long-term goal setting

This adaptive approach keeps engagement high.

---

## 10Ô∏è‚É£ Temporal Structuring & Schema Graph

**Temporal Structuring:**
- Define **phases** of play (e.g., Day Phase, Upkeep Phase).

**Schema Graph:**
- Draw a **graph** showing which mechanics depend on which.
- Arrows = dependencies.

‚úÖ *Example:*
- You must understand ‚Äúdrawing cards‚Äù before ‚Äúplanning future turns.‚Äù

This clarifies learning progression.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Schema Adjacency Matrix (SAM)

Turn the schema graph into a **matrix**:

- Rows and columns = schemas
- Mark which depend on which

‚úÖ *Purpose:*
Identify:
- **Foundational schemas** (lots of arrows going out)
- **Advanced schemas** (lots of arrows going in)

This helps you decide **what to teach first**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Estimate Cognitive Load

For each schema, **estimate how mentally demanding it is.**

‚úÖ *Ask:*
- How many choices does it require?
- How much info must players hold in mind?

‚úÖ *Example Table:*

| Schema              | Load |
|---------------------|------|
| Drawing Cards       | 1    |
| Playing Cards       | 2    |
| Energy Management   | 1    |
| Planning Goals      | 4    |

‚úÖ *Tip:*
Keep early gameplay around **7 units of load**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Cognitive Load Matrix

Combine:

- **Intrinsic load** (per mechanic)
- **Interactivity load** (how mechanics combine)

This gives you a **total load per phase**.

‚úÖ *Purpose:*
Ensure each phase is:

- Challenging, but not overwhelming
- Suitable for your target audience

‚úÖ *Iteration:*
If the load is too high:
- Remove or delay mechanics
- Split them into later tiers

---

## üèÅ What Happens Next?

After Step 13, you have:

‚úÖ A clear design  
‚úÖ A prototype  
‚úÖ A plan to gradually introduce complexity  

The next phase (Evaluation) helps you test whether the game works as intended.

---

## ‚ú® Final Tips

- Don‚Äôt rush. Each step builds on the previous.
- Feel free to iterate‚ÄîVIOLETA is flexible.
- Use the **triadic integration** mindset: Skills + Emotions + Mechanics.
