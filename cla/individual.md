### 1  Definitions

* **“You” (or “Your”)** means the individual copyright owner or legal
  entity making this Agreement with the Project. All entities that
  control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that
  entity are considered a single Contributor. “Control” means  
  (i) the power to direct management, or  
  (ii) ownership of ≥ 50 % of outstanding shares, or  
  (iii) beneficial ownership of the entity.

* **“Contribution”** means any original work of authorship (including
  modifications to an existing work) intentionally submitted by You to
  the Project for inclusion in, or documentation of, any Project
  product (“the Work”). “Submitted” covers any form of electronic,
  verbal, or written communication—except material clearly marked as
  “Not a Contribution”.

### 2  Grant of Copyright Licence

Subject to this Agreement, You hereby **grant the Project and all
recipients** of software distributed by the Project a **perpetual,
world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable** copyright
licence to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and
derivative works **under either**:

1. the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or any later version**, **and**

### 3  Grant of Patent Licence

Subject to this Agreement, You grant the Project and recipients a
perpetual, world-wide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent
licence to make, use, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, to
the extent that patent claims licensable by You are necessarily
infringed by Your Contribution alone or in combination with the Work.
If any entity institutes patent litigation alleging that Your
Contribution or the Work infringes a patent, the patent licences
granted to that entity under this Agreement terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.

1. **Authority.** You represent that you are legally entitled to grant
   the licences above. If your employer has rights to intellectual
   property you create, you represent that you have permission to make
   Contributions on behalf of that employer, that the employer has
   waived such rights, or that the employer has executed a separate
   Corporate CLA with the Project.

2. **Original work.** You represent that each Contribution is your
   original creation. Where this is not the case (§ 7), you will
   disclose the source and applicable licence restrictions.

### 5  Disclaimer of Warranty

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide
Contributions **“AS IS”**, without warranties or conditions of any kind,
either express or implied, including without limitation warranties of
title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular
purpose.
