## Step 7 Workflow
During the "Theme" stage you can now click **Done** to store an element without adding it back into the queue for further breakdown.
After an element is saved the chat is cleared so you can start a new conversation using the `step7_theme_fit` helper to explore how it works in your theme.
When you break down a mechanic and submit new elements, the tool returns to that
mechanic so you can enter its thematic function before moving on to the child
elements. The current item is stored along with the queue so closing the app no
longer loses mechanics that haven't been processed yet.
